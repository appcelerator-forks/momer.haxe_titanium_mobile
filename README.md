# Appcelerator Titanium (v 3.5.0) Haxe Extern Classes

This was generated by using [BuildHX](https://github.com/jgranick/buildhx).

Generating JSCA/JSDuck/JSON output from the titanium-mobile apidoc's is pretty straight forward; Appcelerator has provided [two scripts](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tree/master/apidoc) that are pretty straight forward to use.

My biggest issue in getting this to work was the realization that newer versions of JSDuck changed formatting. I went back to using JSDuck version 3.10.1, and all was well.

## Important Note:
I haven't tested this yet, and am pretty unfamiliar with testing Haxe extern classes; please take a look and open an issue for feedback!

## Less Important Note:
Yes, it would have been nice to just use the [apidoc yaml files](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tree/master/apidoc/Titanium), but that would have been more work.
